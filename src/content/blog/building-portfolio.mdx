Building a portfolio in 2025 demands more than just static HTML. Users expect interactivity, immersion, and performance. In this post, I'll walk through how I built this site using **Next.js 16**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **React Three Fiber**.

## The Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**: For robust routing and server-side rendering.
- **React Three Fiber**: To bring the 3D "JAY" particle effect to life.
- **Framer Motion**: For orchestrating complex entrance animations.
- **Lenis**: For that buttery smooth scroll feel.

## The Particle Effect

The hero section features a particle simulation where thousands of points form text. This was achieved by sampling points from a 3D text geometry and applying a custom shader material.

```javascript
// Pseudo-code for particle logic
const particles = useMemo(() => {
  const geometry = new TextGeometry('JAY', fontOptions);
  return new Float32Array(geometry.attributes.position.array);
}, []);
```

## Optimizing for Performance

With heavy 3D visualizations, performance is key. I used `useFrame` sparingly and offloaded heavy computations to the GPU where possible.

## Conclusion

This portfolio is a living playground. Stay tuned for more updates on my journey with AI engineering!
